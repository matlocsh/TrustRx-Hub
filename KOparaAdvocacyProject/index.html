    <img src="" />
    <h3>1. Patient Safety and Health Outcomes</h3>
    <p>Medication errors can greatly impact patient safety and health outcomes. When patients receive incorrect medications or incorrect doses, it can lead to adverse side-effects, exacerbation of existing conditions, or life-threatening situations.  
      <ul>
          For example
        <li>Overdosing: Administering too much of a medication can cause toxicity, organ damage, or severe side effects.</li>
        <li>Underdosing: Insufficient medication may fail to manage the condition effectively, leading to disease progression.</li>
      </ul>
